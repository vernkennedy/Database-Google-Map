Database Driven Google Map Application

An HTML5-based web application that plots an arbitrary set of geographic points on a map using Google Maps mapping library.

The points are clickable so that further HTML content can be displayed about each point, and the map support common activities such as panning and zooming. 

The geographic points and accompanied popup HTML content are stored in a backend database i.e MySQL,and a PHP script is used to read the data and produce content for the front-end Javascript application to interpret.
